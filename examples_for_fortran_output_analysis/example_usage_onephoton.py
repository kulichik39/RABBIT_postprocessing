This code will help you understand how to use OnePhoton class and different onephoton_...  
namespaces to proccess Fortran output data for the one photon case.

At first, we need to import modules from this repository. We have two possible ways
to do this:
1. Add __init__.py file to this folder as well as all the folders from which we import code 
and then run this script using "python" command with "-m" flag (run module as a script). 
The full command is: "python -m examples_for_fortran_output_analysis.example_usage_onephoton".
2. Add this repository to our system path through sys.path.append("path/to/this/repo")
and run this script as usual.

In this example, we'll use the second approach.

# ============== Initialization with OnePhoton ==============
"""
The main purpose of the OnePhoton class is to initialize the atom, the holes we want to 
consider ionization from and load the raw Fortran output data. 

In this guide we'll consider ionization from the Radon's 6p_3/2 and 6p_1/2 holes.

To load diagonal matrix elements and diagonal eigenvalues (required for e.g. photoabsorption

"should_reload" parameter that tells wheter we should reinitalize diagonal data if they were
previously loaded (False by default).

"""
To load a hole we call a method named "load_hole" inside the one_photon object. 
The Fortran program outputs the probability current for ionisation from a hole to the set of 
possible final states in the continuum (channels). So, when we load a hole we also add all these 
"channels". Furthermore, "load_hole" method tries to find binding energy for the hole based on
Hartree Fock energies or electron kinetic energies from the secondphoton folder.
"load_hole" method also contains "should_reload" parameter that tells wheter we 
should reinitalize a hole if that hole was previously loaded (False by default).

The data for loaded holes are stored in the self.__channels dictionary attribute of the 
one_photon object and can be accessed via the "get_channel_for_hole" method.
