"""
Sometimes we may want to compute Wigner delay and phase based on the data from two different
simultations: one for absorption path and one for emission path. In this scenario, we have to
properly match matrices from both simulations and compute the phase/delay on the interpolated
values (matrix elements). 

The logic for handling this is included in all the functions in the onephoton_delays_and_phases
namespace. You just need to provide the second OnePhoton object (corresponding to the second 
simulation) and a couple of additional parameters which are described below.

We'll show how it's supposed to work in the case of ionization of 5p_3/2 electron in Xenon.
NOTE: all the detailed explanation for the case of one simulation only is shown in 
example_onephoton_matching.py
